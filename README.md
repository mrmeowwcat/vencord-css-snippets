# Vencord CSS Snippets
A library where I keep some Vencord CSS Snippets (taken from the Vencord Server) so It's easier to apply them if you want multiple of them at the same time.

# How to Apply
It is very simple to apply a CSS Snippet to your Vencord. All you have to do is:
1. Make sure you have Vencord installed

      * 1.1. You may download it from [here](https://vencord.dev/download) if you don't have it already installed.
2. Head over to User Settings > Vencord > Themes
